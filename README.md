# Parkinsons-Disease-Detection-using-Inception-and-Xception-with-Attention-Mechanism.ipynb
The project uses InceptionV3 and Xception models with attention mechanisms to detect Parkinsonâ€™s disease from spiral drawings. Images are labeled as "healthy" or "parkinson," preprocessed, and split for training with early stopping. High validation accuracy and strong classification metrics validate model effectiveness.
